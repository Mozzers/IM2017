WarningListener: a class implementing a trivial warning listener and used by 
other classes.

TestRead1: reads an image file of any format supported by ImageIO and 
displays the image in a swing window. Only the first frame of 
multi-frames file is displayed.

TestRead2: reads a DICOM file and displays the first frame in a swing 
window after applying possible grayscale transforms (Modality, VOI and 
Presentation LUT).

Dump: dumps the dicom meta data of a DICOM file.

TestQuerySCU: browses the hierarchy of objects in a remote query SCP, 
gets objects related to a choice of patient/study/series/instance and 
stores them locally. The address and AE title of the remote query SCP
must be changed in the PeerAE constructor call.

TestQuerySCP: acts as a query/retrieve SCP, serving a single object, contained
in the file supplied in argument. On unix/linux, run this class as superuser
or specify a port greater than 1024 in the QueryRetrieveSCP constructor call.
If the SCU will send a MOVE command, its application title, IP address and port
must be registered in the SCP: change the call to registerAE accordingly.

TestWriteSimple: converts a mono-frame image file to dicom.

TestWrite: converts an image file to dicom. Supports multi-frame and uses 
metadata from the input file.

TestWriteCompressed: like TestWrite, but write one dicom file for each supported output compressed transfer syntax.

TestStoreSCP: listens on the default 104 port for an incoming STORE connection,
writes the received object to file "testscp.dcm" and exits. On unix/linux, run
this class as superuser or specify a port greater than 1024 in the StorageSCP
constructor call. The target AE title, address and port must be changed
in the PeerAE constructor call. If the -secure flag is passed, a secure
transport will be used and the server will listen on port 2762 instead of 104.
A valid certificate must have been stored in a keystore file and the 
javax.net.ssl.keyStore and javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword properties must be
set.

TestStoreSCU: reads a file locally and send the DICOM object it contains to a
remote Storage SCP. Change the address, port and AE title in the PeerAE
constructor call. If the -secure flag is passed, a connexion to the SCP
using secure transport will be used.

TestRaw: reads and writes a file in raw mode.
